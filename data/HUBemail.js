        "description": "There are raised bollards at the corner of Glen Dr. and Pipeline Rd. near Glen Elementary. Can 1 or 2 of the bollards nearest the sidewalk be removed to allow cyclists to bike on the right of the road and access the crosswalk activation sensor? I’ve attached a photo of the area with circles around the areas that need to be addressed.<br>It is currently impossible for cyclists to turn left safely, or indeed legally, from Glen Dr (a city designated bike path) onto Pipeline Rd. as cyclists cannot trigger a green light. The crosswalk sensor is unreachable from the road. Cyclists cannot enter the bollard area to reach the lighting pole where the sensor is mounted. Moreover, the road does not have a bike sensor to generate a green light.<br>If the highlighted bollards are removed, cyclists can continue on the right side of the Glen, cross Pipeline alongside the crosswalk, and turn left once they’ve reached the eastern side of Pipeline.<br>Can this change be prioritized? Glen Dr. is a designated bike lane by the city. In addition, the road also serves the elementary school. I think that this minor change would significantly improve the safety of the cycling path so that it is accessible by all ages, and promote more active transportation to the school.",
